translational regulation governs protein production in response to a number of physiological and pathological situations

half of the variation of protein concentration is due to translational control


because the subset of mRNAs actively engaged in translation (i.e. the translatome) reflects the functional readout of the genome at a given time in a given cell type


Polysome profiling is based on sucrose-gradient separation of translated mRNAs, which are associated with polysomes, from untranslated ones.


Polysome profiling can be used for targeted analyses on specific mRNAs (11–13) as well as for holistic analyses (14–17). Furthermore, this technique gives access to the full-length translated mRNAs, including the untranslated regions (UTRs), in contrast to ribosome profiling
